                Hello! I'm<strong> Kendall Ramos</strong>, a dedicated computer science major at the University of Texas at San Antonio, with 
                my roots tracing back to the bustling city of Houston, Texas. My journey into the world of computer 
                science is a vibrant tapestry, a blend of two seemingly divergent yet beautifully entwined passions: 
                anime, technology, and the nostalgic thrill of "Monkey Ball."
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                Before my introduction to the vast world of anime, I found joy and inspiration in the realm of technology 
                through the mesmerizing world of video games. "Super Monkey Ball" for the GameCube was a game that played 
                a pivotal role in nurturing my fascination with technology. This charming and deceptively simple game 
                tasked players with navigating a monkey trapped inside a ball through intricate mazes and obstacle courses. 
                It was an early introduction to 3D graphics, physics simulations, and the magic of interactive digital worlds. 
                Playing "Monkey Ball" was not just a game for me; it was a captivating glimpse into the potential of 
                technology. I was awestruck by how this virtual world could simulate physics, gravity, and momentum with such precision. 
                It fueled my curiosity and ignited a desire to understand how these virtual realities were constructed.

            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                From my earliest memories, I found myself irresistibly drawn into the captivating world of anime. It wasn't just the 
                engaging stories and vibrant characters that held me spellbound; it was the unique ability of anime to envision worlds and concepts 
                that had yet to take shape in our reality. The immense variety of anime genres, from cyberpunk dystopias to futuristic 
                space operas, opened my mind to the concept of stretching the boundaries of the known and embracing the unexplored. As I ventured deeper 
                into the enchanting world of anime, I began to develop a profound appreciation for the intricate technologies that underpinned 
                its creation. Anime relies heavily on the magic of digital art, computer-generated imagery, and complex animation software. 
                These are the very tools that breathe life into fantastical worlds and characters, and they are firmly rooted in the realms of 
                computer science and technology. My fascination with anime's boundless creativity naturally led me to the realm of computer science. 
                I came to realize that computer science isn't confined to lines of code; it's a gateway to forging new possibilities, akin to the 
                uncharted landscapes depicted in anime. In this domain, logic, algorithms, and data converge to fashion innovative solutions and turn 
                previously unimaginable concepts into living, breathing realities.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                My journey through computer science, therefore, has been a thrilling voyage, a place where my passion for anime's 
                limitless imagination harmoniously coexists with the power of technology. Here, I'm able to organize my thoughts and harness 
                my creative spirit, transforming abstract ideas into tangible, real-world innovations. This intersection of my two worlds 
                is a perpetual wellspring of inspiration, where I'm ceaselessly motivated by the boundless potential residing both 
                in anime's creative artistry and in the ever-evolving realm of computer science. Moreover, my journey isn't limited to the 
                theoretical or the abstract; it's also grounded in hands-on experience and technical proficiency. I've mastered an array of 
                technologies, including HTML and CSS, essential tools in the world of web development. My practical skills have been 
                honed through an array of projects, from personal endeavors to creating unique solutions for family and friends, making a tangible 
                impact in the lives of those around me.

            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                In addition to my academic journey and professional experience, I've been actively involved in various technical projects. One 
                notable accomplishment is the creation of a Meal Prep App, completed in the spring of 2023 as part of an Application Programming 
                class. This app is designed to calculate the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and offer a personalized meal preparation plan, incorporating 
                weight and height information. Furthermore, it allows users to track their current and target weights while receiving meal 
                recommendations derived from publicly available recipes on the internet.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                Currently, I'm diligently working on an ongoing project called the Bedbug Incident Database Webpage. This endeavor involves 
                collecting and filtering information from online databases, providing subscribed users with data about hotels in the United 
                States that have experienced bedbug infestations. The website is built using ReactJS and Firebase, creating a user-friendly 
                dashboard with user authentication and read/write capabilities through Firestore. I've also leveraged NodeJS and Google Cloud 
                functions to optimize the web functionality for various automated and trigger-based tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe-p">
                Beyond these technical skills, I bring to the table a collaborative spirit, effective communication abilities, and experience with 
                various coding languages, including Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and Python. My familiarity with a range of technologies, such as 
                ReactJS, Firebase, NodeJS, and UX Design, rounds out my technical arsenal, while my proficiency in SQL adds another layer to my 
                capabilities. In summary, my journey is a captivating interplay of technology, creativity, and the profound appreciation for the 
                limitless possibilities within computer science. It's a path where my love for creating, critical thinking, and the inexhaustible potential 
                of technology intersect to shape the future. As I stand on the precipice of a world defined by both anime's boundless creativity, the 
                nostalgia of "Monkey Ball," and the ever-evolving frontiers of computer science, I eagerly anticipate the exhilarating adventures that 
                lie ahead. My ultimate aspiration is to become a software developer, web developer, or game developer, using my passion for technology 
                and creativity to shape the digital landscapes of tomorrow.
