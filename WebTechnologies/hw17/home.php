					<p>Hey everyone! My name is Kendall, and this is my first webpage at school. Bear with me! I'm Kendall 	Ramos, a passionate computer science major at the University of Texas at San Antonio. My journey blends my love for anime with technology. Anime's imaginative worlds led me to appreciate the tech behind it, guiding me into computer science. It's not just about code; it's a gateway to forging new possibilities, much like the uncharted landscapes in anime. This intersection fuels my creativity and turns abstract ideas into real-world innovations.
