2. Does changing the control variables inside the ‘for statement body’ modify the output?
Change/modify the respective variable one at a time and observe the outcome. Explain/describe
each of the followings -

a. Impact of changing 'end':
    Changing 'end' inside the loop body won't have any impact on the loop since 'end' is used only in the loop 
    initialization. It determines the upper bound for the range of values in the loop, and altering it inside the loop 
    won't affect the current loop iteration.
b. Impact of changing 'increment':
    Changing 'increment' inside the loop body will not impact the current iteration. The loop will continue with the 
    initially assigned 'increment' value for the current iteration. The change will only take effect in the next iteration.
c. Impact of changing 'number':
    Changing 'number' inside the loop body will only affect the local variable 'number' within that specific iteration. 
    It won't impact the loop's behavior in subsequent iterations. Each iteration starts with the value assigned by the 
    loop, and any changes made to 'number' inside the loop won't carry over to the next iteration.

In summary, changing control variables like 'end', 'increment', or 'number' inside the loop body has a localized effect on the 
current iteration and won't affect the overall behavior of the loop in subsequent iterations.
