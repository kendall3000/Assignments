1. Collaboration:
   - I collaborated with the following people on this assignment:
     - Corey (Cousin): Small
       - Corey, who is a previous graduate from UT Austin, provided me with some guidance on understanding the assignment 
       requirements and shared insights into best practices for coding.
       - Mainly, I received some useful tips and suggestions from Corey.
     - Professor Samuel Ang: Medium
        - Professor Samuel Ang provided valuable assistance in helping me better understand the concept of forks and their usage 
        in the context of process management.
        - I had discussions with Professor Ang to clarify doubts and gain a deeper understanding of the fork and exec logic, which 
        greatly enhanced my understanding of the assignment.

2. Correctness:
   - I believe that the code I implemented is correct based on my testing and understanding of the assignment requirements. However, 
   I have tested the programs with sample input files and compared the results with the `wc` tool.

3. Progress and Issues:
   - I made significant progress in understanding the assignment requirements and implementing the code.
   - The `wordcount` program is working as expected, accurately counting words in the provided input files.
   - In `multiple_wordcount.c`, I initially encountered a minor issue related to file paths. After fixing the paths, the program 
   worked as intended.
   - While I didn't struggle with the makefile setup since that part was already done i prosume, I did spend some time 
   fine-tuning the code to ensure efficiency and readability.
  
4. Comments:
   - Challenges:
     - One challenge was understanding how to correctly use `fork()` and `execl()` to create and execute child processes in 
     `multiple_wordcount.c`. It required careful consideration of the process flow.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     - To make this assignment more interesting, it could include additional features or extensions, such as handling word counts 
     in binary files or implementing concurrent file processing.
   - Overall Experience:
     - Overall, this assignment was a valuable learning experience in process management and file operations in C. It provided 
     hands-on experience in working with system calls and processes.
